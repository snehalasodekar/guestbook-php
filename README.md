# guestbook-php
Create a guestbook using php concepts of oop and MVC

## Learning objectives
- Storing data in files
- Converting complex constructs (array/objects) to string representation.

## Mission
- Any visitor on te page can leave a message on your page which will be saved to a text file.(using file_get_content, file_pu_content and json_encode, json_decode)
- Display all the message to the page with the latest mesage first.

## Requirements
  To implement a guestbook my requirements are : 
  1. User **Post** entries data like (**user name, Post message title, Post message, Post entry date**)
  2. A **form** through which I can receive data above data from user.
  3. Need some buttons 
     1. New Post Message : Redirect user to add new post message
     2. A text file (guestMessage.txt) to save these messages to it.
     3. View All Post : Display all available post messages
  4. Add a form for accept number of post user want to display.

## Implementation 
 1. I want to make this project using MVC, so in the beginning my folder structure will be,
     <img width="300px" src="src/img/basicMvcFolderStructure.png"/>
 2. The Src folder will have images used for the project. 
 2. I create multiple view files and access them through controller as per the conditions.
 3. The general description of flow and files code.
    1. CONTROLLER :
       - A controller method **invoke()** called by **index.php**,  call or load a view as per user requirements or inputs.
       - Like to display all post it call **getAllPosts()** method from Model and load the returned data to index file by loading **allPostView.php** view.
    2. MODEL : 
       - Define **Post.php** file, this file contains the properties about post as ($firstName,$surname,$title,$message,$image,$date) and has getter methods to get values of these properties. (this file considers as a database table structure)
       - Define another model file **PostLoader.php**, this file includes Post.php file and have methods (insertPostData(), getAllPosts()). 
          - insertPostData() : collect data from controller and do some operation on it and save it to **guestMessage.txt** file using **file_put_contents** and **json_encode**.
          - getAllPosts() : collect data from **guestMessage.txt** file using **file_get_contents** and **json_decode** and send it to controller.
    3. VIEW : 
       - allPostView.php : Used to display all available post messages from guestBook.txt file also add **New Post** button (on click user redirects to newPostView)
       - newPostView.php : Add Post Message insert data form and on submit it sends data to controller and from controller to model and text file.
    4. Below is basic flow of the guestbook, 
      <img src="src/img/guestbookBasicFlow.png"/>
    5. Also, added emoji's and replace bad words with asterisk '*' and form to allPostView.php page to allow user to view specific number of post.
